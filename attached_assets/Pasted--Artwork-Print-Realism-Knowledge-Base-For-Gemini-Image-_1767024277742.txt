# 🎨 Artwork Print Realism Knowledge Base
## For Gemini Image Generation - Lovable Integration

---

## ❌ The Problem

The design appears **"pasted on"** or **"floating"** on the apparel instead of looking like a real print.

![Problem visualization]
- Design is flat, ignores fabric folds
- Colors too saturated/digital
- No fabric texture showing through
- Lighting on design doesn't match environment
- Design doesn't follow body contours

---

## ✅ The Solution

Add these **mandatory instructions** to your Gemini image generation prompt to ensure the artwork integrates realistically with the fabric.

## 📋 COPY-PASTE PROMPT BLOCK

Add this entire block to your generation prompt **before** or **after** your design description:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    ⚠️ CRITICAL: PRINT REALISM REQUIREMENTS ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The design/artwork MUST appear as a REAL PHYSICAL PRINT on the fabric:

【FABRIC INTEGRATION】
• The design is PRINTED INTO the fabric fibers using screen-print/DTG printing
• Subtle fabric weave texture is visible THROUGH the printed ink areas
• The ink is ABSORBED into the material, NOT sitting on top like a sticker
• Print has the characteristics of real ink on real textile

【FABRIC PHYSICS - DESIGN FOLLOWS THE FABRIC】
• Design follows EVERY fold, wrinkle, and crease in the garment
• Design stretches and compresses over body contours (chest, shoulders, stomach)
• Where fabric bunches up, the design bunches up identically
• Where fabric pulls tight, the design stretches with it
• The design is NOT flat - it exists in 3D space on the garment
• Design warps naturally with the cylindrical shape of the torso

【LIGHTING MUST BE CONSISTENT】  
• The SAME light source illuminates both the garment AND the printed design
• Shadows from folds fall ACROSS the design, darkening those areas
• Highlights on raised/stretched fabric areas also brighten the design
• The print does NOT have its own separate lighting
• No "glowing" or "backlit" appearance on the design

【COLOR ACCURACY FOR REAL PRINTS】
• Print colors appear as REAL INK on fabric (slightly less saturated than digital file)
• Colors are subtly muted compared to the original digital artwork
• On white fabric: colors appear close to original but with fabric texture
• On dark fabric: colors may appear slightly different as ink interacts with base
• No "neon" or "glowing" colors unless it's actual reflective ink

【3D PERSPECTIVE】
• Design follows the 3D curvature of the human torso
• Slight perspective distortion toward edges (design wraps around body)
• Design is NOT perfectly rectangular - it curves with the body shape
• Top of design may appear slightly smaller than bottom due to chest curve

【WHAT TO AVOID】
✗ Design appearing perfectly flat like a digital overlay
✗ Design edges that are too sharp/digital looking
✗ Design that ignores wrinkles and folds in the fabric
✗ Design with different lighting than the rest of the image
✗ Colors that are too vibrant/saturated for real printing
✗ Design that looks like a sticker or iron-on transfer
✗ Any "floating" or "hovering" appearance

【WHAT TO ACHIEVE】
✓ Design looks like it was professionally printed at a print shop
✓ You cannot tell where fabric ends and print begins
✓ Design and garment share identical lighting and shadows
✓ Fabric texture subtly shows through printed areas
✓ Natural imperfections consistent with real screen printing
✓ Looks like a real photo of a real printed shirt

## 🔧 Integration Examples

### Example 1: Basic Integration

```javascript
const prompt = `
Generate a photorealistic image of a person wearing a white t-shirt.

${PRINT_REALISM_BLOCK}  // ← Insert the block above

The shirt has a printed design showing: A tropical skull with palm trees, 
sunset, waves, and hibiscus flowers in orange, teal, and dark green colors.
The print is centered on the chest, medium size.

[...rest of your prompt for model, environment, etc...]
`;
```

### Example 2: With Design Description Variable

```javascript
const generateMockupPrompt = (designDescription, shirtColor) => `
Create a photorealistic product photo of a model wearing a ${shirtColor} long-sleeve shirt.

## 🎯 Condensed Version (Minimum Viable)

If you need a shorter version, use this minimum block:

```
【PRINT REALISM - MANDATORY】
The design is PHYSICALLY PRINTED on the fabric, NOT digitally overlaid:
• Fabric texture visible through printed areas
• Design follows ALL folds, wrinkles, and body contours  
• Same lighting affects both garment and print (shadows cross over design)
• Colors appear as real ink (slightly less saturated than digital)
• Design wraps around 3D body shape with natural perspective
• Must look like a real photograph of a real printed garment
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After generation, verify these points:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Can you see fabric texture through the design? | ☐ |
| Does the design follow visible folds/wrinkles? | ☐ |
| Do shadows fall naturally across the design? | ☐ |
| Does the design wrap around the body curve? | ☐ |
| Are colors realistic (not overly saturated)? | ☐ |
| Does it look like a real photo, not a mockup? | ☐ |

## 🔄 Iterative Improvement Prompts

If initial results aren't realistic enough, add these reinforcement phrases:

### For flat-looking designs:
```
"The design must show the natural undulation of the fabric surface - 
it cannot appear flat or 2D. Every micro-wrinkle affects the design."
```

### For colors too bright:
```
"The print colors should appear as they would from a real DTG printer - 
slightly muted by the fabric absorption, not digital-perfect colors."
```

### For missing fabric texture:
```
"The cotton weave pattern of the shirt must be subtly visible through 
the printed ink, especially in lighter colored areas of the design."
```

### For lighting mismatch:
```
"The printed design receives light from the exact same source as the 
rest of the garment - there should be zero lighting difference between 
printed and non-printed areas of the fabric."
```

## ✅ Summary

1. **Copy** the prompt block from this document
2. **Paste** it into your Gemini generation prompt
3. **Place** it before or after your design description
4. **Test** using the checklist
5. **Iterate** with reinforcement phrases if needed

The key is explicitly telling the model that this is a **REAL PHYSICAL PRINT** and describing exactly how real prints behave on real fabric.
