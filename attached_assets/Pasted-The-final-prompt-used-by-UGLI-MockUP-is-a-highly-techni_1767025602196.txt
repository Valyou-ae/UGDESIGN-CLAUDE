The final prompt used by UGLI MockUP is a highly technical, multi-section specification designed to force the AI into "rendering" mode rather than "creative" mode.
Because you are likely providing a design image as the primary input, the app sends your artwork as [IMAGE 1] and a generated character headshot as [IMAGE 2].
Here is the exact structure of the final prompt generated for a standard White T-Shirt (DTG) on a Young Adult Female model in E-Commerce Clean style:
THE FINAL PROMPT SPECIFICATION
TASK: PHOTOREALISTIC MOCKUP RENDER SPECIFICATION
You are a photorealistic rendering engine. Your task is to generate a single mockup image according to the following technical specification. Adherence to all rules is mandatory.
SECTION 1: CORE ASSETS & UNBREAKABLE RULES
RULE 1: MODEL IDENTITY LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The model in the final render MUST be the EXACT SAME PERSON as shown in the provided reference headshot [IMAGE 2]. This is a visual identity lock. Do not change their face, hair, skin tone, or body build.
CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: You MUST IGNORE the background and lighting of the headshot [IMAGE 2]. It is a technical asset for facial identity ONLY. Use the Scene & Camera parameters in SECTION 2 for the final image's environment and lighting.
RULE 2: DESIGN ASSET LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The design on the garment MUST be a PERFECT, 1:1, PIXEL-PERFECT, STYLISTICALLY IDENTICAL COPY of the provided design asset [IMAGE 1]. It must not be redrawn, re-interpreted, or have its style changed.
RULE 3: COLOR & FIT LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The garment's fabric color MUST be EXACTLY White (Hex: #FFFFFF).
The garment is size M and must fit the model realistically according to its size.
SECTION 2: RENDER PARAMETERS
1. CHARACTER BLUEPRINT:
Character ID: DT_JORDAN_12345
Name: Jordan
Somatic Profile (Source of Truth): This model has a blended build, consistent with their Diverse heritage, and is approximately 5'3" (160cm) tall. A healthy, average build with natural curves. As a Young Adult, their physique shows characteristics such as peak physical condition, defined musculature, firm skin. Their limbs are of average proportion relative to their torso.
Verification: The final rendered person must match [IMAGE 2] visually.
2. GARMENT & PRINT SPECIFICATION:
4. GARMENT BLUEPRINT (IMMUTABLE CONSTRUCTION):
Fit: Regular Fit (not slim, not oversized).
Hem: Straight Hem with no side slits.
Collar Type: Ribbed Crewneck (a simple, rounded collar with no points, no buttons, no placket).
Sleeve Type: Set-in Short Sleeves.
PRINT SIZE: The design asset [IMAGE 1] must be printed on the garment at a width of 14 inches.
CONDITION: Garment worn 2-3 times and washed approximately 5 times, natural realistic fabric folds (7+ visible creases and micro-wrinkles from natural wear), slight micro-pilling visible on close inspection, colors slightly softened by approximately 5% from washing, fabric has comfortable lived-in softness with natural drape, authentic worn-in appearance, micro-wrinkles concentrated at underarms and sides, realistic everyday garment condition.
PRINT METHOD: Apply the design using the Direct-to-Garment method: design printed with DTG inkjet process directly into fabric fibers, soft hand feel with no additional texture, matte finish matching fabric sheen, print sits flush with fabric surface creating seamless integration, colors slightly absorbed into fibers creating natural appearance, design stretches and drapes perfectly with fabric without cracking or distortion, no raised or embossed effect, subtle highlights following natural fabric texture, print follows all fabric contours and folds naturally.
3. SCENE & CAMERA SPECIFICATION:
Environment: "a professional photography studio with a seamless light gray backdrop".
Lighting: Use the Classic Three-Point Lighting preset: key light at 45° front-side, soft fill light opposite at half intensity, rim light from behind for edge separation, balanced 5600K daylight temperature, soft shadows with clear product definition, controlled highlights on reflective surfaces.
Camera & Angle: CAMERA/ANGLE: Front View. The camera is positioned directly in front of the subject for a symmetrical, straight-on view. The model is facing the camera. The framing is a classic Medium Shot, cropped from just above the head to just below the waist. This is a standard commercial product shot with natural proportions and no perspective distortion. Lens: 85mm at f/5.6.
4. 3D DISTORTION PHYSICS (CRITICAL FOR REALISM):
The flat design [IMAGE 1] MUST realistically distort over the 3D curves and folds of the garment.
Cylindrical Wrap: The torso is a CYLINDER with approximately 15cm radius (30cm diameter, ~12" chest width). You must map the flat design onto this cylindrical surface. MENTAL MODEL: Imagine wrapping a rectangular sticker around a soda can. The center of the sticker (facing you) looks normal width. The edges of the sticker (wrapping around the sides) appear much narrower due to the angle. This is the EXACT effect needed on the t-shirt.
Fold Interaction: The design is BONDED to the fabric surface. It is not floating above - it IS the fabric. Therefore: Every fold in the fabric causes a corresponding distortion in the design. If there is a fold running vertically through the letter "O", the "O" must show the fold: The left side of the "O" and right side will not align perfectly. The fold line will create a visible discontinuity. The circular shape will appear "bent" at the fold. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Flat, undistorted designs on folded fabric = INSTANT FAILURE.
