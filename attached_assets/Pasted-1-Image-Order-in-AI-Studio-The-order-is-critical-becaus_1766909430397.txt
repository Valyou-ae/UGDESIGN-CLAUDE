1. Image Order in AI Studio
The order is critical because the prompt explicitly references the images by their position in the stack.
First Attachment: The Design Artwork (This becomes [IMAGE 1]).
Second Attachment: The Persona Lock Photo (This becomes [IMAGE 2]).
Third Attachment (Optional): A "Previous Mockup" is NOT recommended for the generation call. It confuses the AI's understanding of the current garment's 3D volume. Instead, rely on a fixed Seed value for environment consistency.
2. Persona Photo Handling
Method: You should upload a high-quality headshot directly to AI Studio.
Format: PNG is preferred. JPEG is acceptable, but PNG avoids compression artifacts that can distort the facial "geometry" the AI uses for matching.
Why not text only? Text descriptions like "Hispanic woman with brown hair" are too broad. By providing a physical image ([IMAGE 2]), you invoke the model's "Visual Identity Lock," forcing it to map specific facial landmarks from that photo onto the generated character.
3. Design Application Reference
The prompt must treat the design as a technical asset, not a suggestion. Use this exact syntax:
Reference: Always use [IMAGE 1].
Command: "Apply the provided design asset [IMAGE 1] to the garment. It must be a 1:1 pixel-perfect copy."
Placement: You must specify physical dimensions, e.g., "The design from [IMAGE 1] must be printed at exactly 12 inches wide on the center chest."
4. Color Specification
AI Studio works best when you provide both a human-readable name and a hexadecimal code.
Structure: "The fabric color of the garment MUST be EXACTLY [Color Name] (Hex: #[HexCode])."
Example: "The fabric color of the sweatshirt MUST be EXACTLY Navy Blue (Hex: #000080)."
AOP Rule: For All-Over-Print, tell the AI to: "Derive the garment base color from the overall perceived background color of [IMAGE 1]."
5. The "Golden" Prompt Structure
A successful prompt should be structured like a Technical Specification Document, not a creative story. Use the following key sections:
Part A: The Identity Lock (Who)
"RULE: The model in the final render MUST be the EXACT SAME PERSON as shown in the reference headshot [IMAGE 2]. Ignore the background of [IMAGE 2]; use it for facial identity and build reference only."
Part B: The Product Blueprint (What)
"Garment Specification: A professional 100% heavy cotton crewneck t-shirt. The fabric must show natural cotton weave texture. The fit is 'Regular Fit' on a size Medium frame."
Part C: The Physics Engine (The Secret Sauce)
"3D Distortion Physics: Map the flat design from [IMAGE 1] onto the cylindrical volume of the model's torso. At the side edges, the design MUST compress horizontally by 35%. The design must follow every fold and wrinkle of the fabric—if a fold appears, the design must bend and distort with it."
Part D: The Lens & Lighting (How)
"Photography: 85mm lens at f/8, positioned 6 feet away at eye level. Use a Three-Point Studio Lighting setup (5500K) with soft fill shadows."
Part E: The Negative Prompt (Exclusions)
"Negative Prompt: flat sticker appearance, floating logo, bad anatomy, extra fingers, cartoon, illustration, watermark, low resolution, blurry edges."
Summary for Replit Debugging
If your Replit mockups are coming out looking like "flat stickers" or the faces are changing:
Check your index: Ensure params.designImage is at contents[0] and personaLockImage is at contents[1].
Add the Cylinder Rule: Without the instruction to "compress horizontally at the edges," the AI will almost always render the design as a flat rectangle on top of the shirt.
Use PNG for Persona: Low-quality JPEG headshots lead to "AI-face drift."
